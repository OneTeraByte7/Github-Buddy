# A Honey Website with Payment Gateway

## Description

This project is an e-commerce website designed for honey sellers to showcase and sell their products online. It integrates a payment gateway to facilitate secure online transactions. Customers can browse available honey varieties, add them to their cart, and complete their purchase using various payment methods.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd honey-website
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

    (Replace `npm` with `yarn` if you are using Yarn.)

3.  **Configure the environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url>
    PAYMENT_GATEWAY_API_KEY=<your_payment_gateway_api_key>
    PAYMENT_GATEWAY_SECRET=<your_payment_gateway_secret>
    // Add other necessary environment variables here
    ```

    (Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials and configurations.)

4.  **Set up the database:**

    Run database migrations or seed the database with initial data, if necessary. Refer to your database documentation for specific instructions.

    ```bash
    // Example using a command-line tool like Prisma:
    npx prisma migrate dev
    npx prisma db seed
    ```

5.  **Start the application:**

    ```bash
    npm start  # or yarn start
    ```

    This will typically start the application server, and you can access the website in your browser at `http://localhost:<port>` (replace `<port>` with the actual port number).
